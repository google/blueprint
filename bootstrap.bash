# This script serves two purposes.  First, it can bootstrap the standalone
# Blueprint to generate the minibp binary.  To do this simply run the script
# with no arguments from the desired build directory.
#
# It can also be invoked from another script to bootstrap a custom Blueprint-
# based build system.  To do this, the invoking script must first set some or
# all of the following environment variables, which are documented below where
# their default values are set:
#
#   BOOTSTRAP
#   WRAPPER
#   SRCDIR
#   BLUEPRINTDIR
#   BUILDDIR
#   NINJA_BUILDDIR
#   GOROOT
#
# The invoking script should then run this script, passing along all of its
# command line arguments.

# the bootstrap script.
