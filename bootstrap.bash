# This script serves two purposes.  First, it can bootstrap the standalone
# Blueprint to generate the minibp binary.  To do this simply run the script
# with no arguments from the desired build directory.
#
# It can also be invoked from another script to bootstrap a custom Blueprint-
# based build system.  To do this, the invoking script must first set some or
# all of the following environment variables, which are documented below where
# their default values are set:
#
#   BOOTSTRAP
#   SRCDIR
#   BOOTSTRAP_MANIFEST
#   TOP_BLUEPRINT
#   GOROOT
#   GOOS
#   GOARCH
#   GOCHAR
#
# The invoking script should then run this script, passing along all of its
# command line arguments.

# BOOTSTRAP should be set to the path of the bootstrap script.  It can be
# either an absolute path or one relative to the build directory (which of
# these is used should probably match what's used for SRCDIR).
[ -z "$BOOTSTRAP" ] && BOOTSTRAP="${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"

# SRCDIR should be set to the path of the root source directory.  It can be
# either an absolute path or a path relative to the build directory.  Whether
# its an absolute or relative path determines whether the build directory can
# be moved relative to or along with the source directory without re-running
# the bootstrap script.

# the source tree.  It is used to bootstrap a build output directory from when
# the script is run manually by a user.

# TOP_BLUEPRINT Is the path to the top-level Blueprints file in the source tree
